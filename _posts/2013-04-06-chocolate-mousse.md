<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This was my first run at chocolate mousse and I looked around the web for recipes that didn&#8217;t involve creme fraiche because it can be a little tough to get a hold of here. &nbsp;I found one that does most of the work in a food processor, which was fine by me. &nbsp;This particular batch was made to serve 8-12 so there was almost a whole pound of chocolate.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Process that up until its ground pretty fine.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then you can heat up the milk mixture and let it get nice and hot because this mixture will be responsible for melting the chocolate. &nbsp;Process it all until the chocolate is melted, and add some vanilla extract (which is crazy expensive) and process a little more.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The next step requires some kind of mixer, because you have to beat heavy cream until it starts to hold a shape:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When finished put it in the fridge for about an hour to set. &nbsp;You can transfer to individual serving glasses at this time, but I was bringing my mousse to a dinner and didn&#8217;t want to travel with all those individual servings.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It turned out really good. &nbsp;With 14oz of chocolate I don&#8217;t think you can mess anything up too bad but I was expecting something more like pudding and was pleasantly surprised by how much the texture was like mousse made with eggs and stuff. &nbsp;</span>
