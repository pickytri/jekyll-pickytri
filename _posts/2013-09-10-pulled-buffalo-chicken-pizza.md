<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A local pizza place does a great buffalo chicken pizza so I decided to try my hand at it. &nbsp;I decided to go with pulled chicken because this was a saturday and I had plenty of time for slow cooking. &nbsp;The plan was to make two pizzas and have one with a tomato sauce &nbsp;and the other with more of a ranch sauce. &nbsp;So after swimming in the morning I started the 4 chicken breasts in the slow cooker with buffalo sauce, some garlic, butter and a package of dry ranch dressing:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The cooking times I found from different recipes varied from 3 hours to 7 hours on low or high. &nbsp;I was a bit worried because the last time I tried pulled pork I cooked it for 6 or 7 hours on low and that wasn&#8217;t enough time. &nbsp;I ended up doing about 2 hours on low, then about 2 on high and then another 3 on low while I went for a bike ride (I turned it down because I didn&#8217;t want to overcook the chicken). &nbsp;It worked out pretty well, when I got back from my bike ride the apartment smelled amazing and the chicken was tender and cooked perfectly:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They looked amazing, and pulling it apart with the two forks was real easy. &nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After pulling, I put it back into the slow cooker and started to work on the pizza. &nbsp;I was rushing a bit at this part because I was starving so I didn&#8217;t get the pizza dough as thin as I would have liked, but it still worked out.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And because my oven doesn&#8217;t get hot enough, I have to cook the dough for about 4-5mins first and then add the toppings:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So I ended up just putting a whole layer of pulled chicken down and it was liquidy enough to not need any sauce so my plan of comparing a tomato and ranch pizza didn&#8217;t work out. &nbsp;I topped it with frozen mozzarella cheese and back into the oven until cheese melts.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I then made and cooked the second pizza and was finally ready to eat. &nbsp;After over 7 hours of cooking and 50 miles of biking, I was really ready to eat. &nbsp;Usually after that kind of bike ride I can easily eat a whole pizza so I went ahead and started:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The pizza turned out to be delicious. &nbsp;Maybe a bit on the spicy side because of the buffalo chicken, although I think not having a whole layer &#8211; only clumps of it would have solved this problem. &nbsp;I ended up only finishing 5 of the 6 slices because I&#8217;m pretty sure there was almost a whole pound of chicken on each pizza. &nbsp;This was the first time I haven&#8217;t been able to finish a pizza after a long bike ride that I can remember. &nbsp;The good news is I have about another pound or so left of pulled chicken for leftover meals!

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-4 chicken breasts (2-3lbs ish)
