Guacamole is one of those things I never tried for the longest time because it was made of all vegetables and how could that be good? &nbsp;Well I was wrong, guacamole is delicious. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also quite simple to make, you just have to make sure you get the portions right. &nbsp;The first time I made it (for 3 people), I used 6 avocados because I wanted some extra&#8230; well I got some extra. &nbsp;Like 3 whole meals worth of extra. &nbsp;Still delicious, but you have to eat it pretty quickly. &nbsp;As I said, not much to it, here is everything I used:

First you have to prepare the onions and tomatoes by chopping and dicing them. &nbsp;The good thing is you can choose how chunky or thin you want the final product by how thick you chop the onions and tomatoes.

Set those aside, and pit and peel the avocados and put them into a large mixing bowl.

Add onions/tomatoes and some garlic.

Then mix this all together and you have guacamole:

It&#8217;s best if you let it set in the fridge for an hour or two, but pretty good right away too. &nbsp;This batch came out great, and is pretty hard to mess up. &nbsp;The key is choosing avocados that are ripe, you should be able to squeeze them, but not too easily. &nbsp;It should feel like it would be easy to mash. &nbsp;At least that&#8217;s how I choose them. 

Recipe: (serves 4)

-3 avocados  
-1 lime, juiced  
-1tsp salt  
-2 onion  
-2 roma tomatoes  
-1tsp minced garlic

Pit peel and mash up avocados with salt and lime juice. &nbsp;Stir in diced onions/tomatoes and garlic. &nbsp;Refrigerate for one hour and serve.
