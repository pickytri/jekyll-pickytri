Guacamole is one of those things I never tried for the longest time because it was made of all vegetables and how could that be good? &nbsp;Well I was wrong, guacamole is delicious. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also quite simple to make, you just have to make sure you get the portions right. &nbsp;The first time I made it (for 3 people), I used 6 avocados because I wanted some extra&#8230; well I got some extra. &nbsp;Like 3 whole meals worth of extra. &nbsp;Still delicious, but you have to eat it pretty quickly. &nbsp;As I said, not much to it, here is everything I used:

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4120.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4120-300x200.jpg" width="640" /></a>
</div>

First you have to prepare the onions and tomatoes by chopping and dicing them. &nbsp;The good thing is you can choose how chunky or thin you want the final product by how thick you chop the onions and tomatoes. 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4121.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4121-300x200.jpg" width="640" /></a>
</div>

Set those aside, and pit and peel the avocados and put them into a large mixing bowl. 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4136.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4136-300x200.jpg" width="640" /></a>
</div>

Next add the salt and 2 limes worth of juice. &nbsp;The lime juice is important for keeping the bright green color I&#8217;ve been told. &nbsp;Anyways mix and mash that all up, then add the onions/tomatoes and some garlic. 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4139.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4139-300x200.jpg" width="640" /></a>
</div>

Then mix this all together and you have guacamole:

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4141.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_4141-300x200.jpg" width="640" /></a>
</div>

It&#8217;s best if you let it set in the fridge for an hour or two, but pretty good right away too. &nbsp;This batch came out great, and is pretty hard to mess up. &nbsp;The key is choosing avocados that are ripe, you should be able to squeeze them, but not too easily. &nbsp;It should feel like it would be easy to mash. &nbsp;At least that&#8217;s how I choose them. 

Recipe: (serves 4)

-3 avocados  
-1 lime, juiced  
-1tsp salt  
-1/2 onion  
-2 roma tomatoes  
-1tsp minced garlic

Pit peel and mash up avocados with salt and lime juice. &nbsp;Stir in diced onions/tomatoes and garlic. &nbsp;Refrigerate for one hour and serve.
