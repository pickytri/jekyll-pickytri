<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So the idea here is to use soft tortillas as a base for a &#8220;pizza&#8221; that is more like an open faced taco. &nbsp;I used corn tortillas which fell apart pretty easily and tasted kind of weird, I think I should have stuck with flour tortillas. &nbsp;Anyway, the first layer I used was some chopped onion and ground beef mixed with taco seasoning. &nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then I fried it up with some salt and pepper. &nbsp;I think the onions were a bit much because of my toppings, but I had all that onion lying around anyway so I had to use it somewhere.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While all this frying is going on, I baked the tortillas for a little bit. &nbsp;Topped them with the ground beef and added some cheese for stickiness and top with another tortilla to support more toppings after baking for a bit more.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And after the cheese is nice and melted pop those guys out of the oven and prepare your toppings. &nbsp;I used guacamole. &nbsp;I had some lying around because I seem to always be making batches fit for a crowd of people even if its just for me.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So these turned out pretty good. &nbsp;After baking the weird taste of the corn tortilla went away and I used enough guac that instead of dipping the tacos, I just spread it evenly on top. &nbsp;Last week whole foods had a special on avocados &#8211; 5 for $5, I made 3 batches of 5 avocado guac all for myself. &nbsp;Guacamole and chips might not be the most healthy dinner 4 nights a week, but it sure was delicious. &nbsp;They were also selling cases for $48, I&#8217;m not sure how many avocados come in a case, but I was sorely tempted to find out. &nbsp;In the end I decided against a case because I was spending Thurs-Sun in North Carolina so wouldn&#8217;t have enough time to enjoy all that guacamole. &nbsp;Good thing we made some guac in NC ðŸ™‚</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I know, its been like a month and a half since my last update, I&#8217;ve just been eating the same foods a whole bunch (like guacamole) and also didn&#8217;t get my camera out when my roommate made some slow cooker pulled pork that turned out fantastic, or the next day when I combined the leftovers with mac and cheese. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll try to keep this more up to date, tomorrow I am making stuffed burgers and should be able to post those this weekend sometime. &nbsp;So fear not, I have not stopped cooking or eating, just got a little lazy.</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recipe:</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-1lb ground beef</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-1 package taco seasoning (1.25oz)</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-4 corn tortillas</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-12oz shredded cheese</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-leftover guacamole</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-1/2 onion, chopped</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Preheat oven to 350 and then bake tortillas for 15-20mins. &nbsp;Combine beef, onion and seasoning and mix together well. &nbsp;Fry beef mixture in a large skillet until browned. &nbsp;After tortillas have baked, place beef mixture on top of 2 of them and add cheese and then add the other 2 tortillas and bake until cheese has melted. &nbsp;Serve with guacamole.</span>
