<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So my roommate and I have done stuffed burgers quite a bit, but this is the first time I got around to photographing them. &nbsp;We always use some kind of cheese, this time it was mozzarella, but we&#8217;ve had success with cheddar and monterey jack and a few others. &nbsp;The thing with the stuffed burgers is they are pretty large, about 1/2lb of beef each, so be prepared. &nbsp;To start we mix the meat (this time we used a 3/4lb beef and 3/4lb buffalo mixture) with some minced garlic, salt, pepper, onion, breadcrumb and an egg, oh and a bit of worcestershire sauce. &nbsp;The measurements came from a recipe at one time, but I have long since forgotten and go by feel now. &nbsp;Usually with 1.5lb of meat a half onion is good, just 1 egg, a tablespoon or so of worcestershire sauce, a tablespoon of minced garlic, and add breadcrumbs little by little until everything sticks together nicely.</span>

</div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So get in there and mix it up barehanded and make sure it is pretty homogeneous before forming some patties. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll be cold, and you will end up washing your hands about 5 or 6 times throughout the forming and cooking of these, but it&#8217;s worth it. &nbsp;Also, you probably don&#8217;t want to handle raw meat if you have an open cut on your hand, so get your roommate to do it and laugh as he complains about the cold and how many times he has to wash his hands&#8230;</span>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qWmUblmJgek/UiVRuhQrObI/AAAAAAAAA4E/rC_3sSYFOL0/s1600/IMG_4181.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_4181-300x200.jpg" width="640" /></span></a>
</div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Forming the patties takes a little practice, for the stuffed burgers (the larger ones pictured) I grab enough meat to fill both of my hands cupped together. &nbsp;Then I split this in half and form a slight bowl shape to place the cheese in, and then top with the other half and merge the two halves along the edges to ensure the cheese doesn&#8217;t burst out during cooking. &nbsp;For the leftover meat we usually make a small patty or two, just make a slight indent in the center on the top and bottom to help shape it.</span>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So next you heat up your grill for a while (make sure to clean it, we&#8217;ve started a few grease fires; and make sure you have enough propane, we&#8217;ve run out a couple times &#8211; which once led to a grease fire on the stove). &nbsp;Anyway, after the grill is really hot, around 500F or so, you can put the stuffed burgers on and turn the heat down to around 350-400F or so. &nbsp;Let them cook for about 5mins, and flip them over (at this point you can add the smaller patty). &nbsp;You might see some corn in the background, which you want to soak for a couple hours before cooking (unless you want to start another fire&#8230; been there, done that), and it takes about 20-30mins so put them on right after you light the grill and turn occasionally to prevent too much burning on one side. &nbsp;After flipping the burgers you want to wait around 4mins or so before putting slices of cheese on top (sometimes being stuffed with cheese just isn&#8217;t enough) and place the buns on the grill to get them nice and toasted. &nbsp;Wait until the cheese melts and the buns are crispy until removing everything. &nbsp;Unfortunately at this point in the cooking process my cameras&#8217; battery died so I switched over to the cell phone camera for the final product:</span>

  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Needless to say, this was all pretty delicious. &nbsp;Mozzarella is good because it gets real gooey when melted. &nbsp;This burger just needed some bacon&#8230;</span>
