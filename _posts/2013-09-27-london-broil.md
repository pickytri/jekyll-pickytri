To celebrate my recent promotion my roommate and I decided to have steak. &nbsp;Whole Foods was having a deal on London Broil and I remember this being in the top 3 things I enjoyed off the grill as a kid (the others being burgers and salmon), so I went ahead and got a 1.5lb piece. &nbsp;The key to a good London Broil is marinading it, and I only had about 3 hours so I did a quick search on the internet and found a soy sauce and garlic marinade that looked good and said for anywhere between 30mins to 24hrs. &nbsp;So I went ahead and mixed that up:

  The marinade had garlic powder AND minced garlic. &nbsp;Sounded pretty good to me, so I dumped the london broil and marinade into a freezer bag and let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours:

  After about 3 hours or so, we headed to the grill and started cooking this thing:

  We did about 5-7mins per side and the meat was about 2&#8243; thick. &nbsp;I had a temperature probe and medium rare is supposed to be 130F, but when the temperature read 115F (and climbing) it felt pretty firm and I was worried that we might have overcooked it. &nbsp;Either way, after you take it off the grill let it rest (ignore the dirty dishes in the sink please, I swear they&#8217;re all clean now&#8230;)

  The hardest part is waiting for the meat to rest. &nbsp;It takes about 5mins, but you can smell the great flavor and all you can do is stare at it and then your watch and wonder why only 2 seconds have passed and then hope you didn&#8217;t overcook it. &nbsp;After what seemed like forever, it was finally time to cut into it and see how we did:

  Phew! Medium rare! &nbsp;

  And there you have it &#8211; my promotion steak dinner. &nbsp;It was really tasty. &nbsp;We didn&#8217;t have to worry at all, the marinade was great even with only 3ish hrs and it was cooked perfectly. &nbsp;
