<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After seeing a commercial on the food network for pre made and frozen green beans and almond slivers, I decided I could probably make it and eat it&#8230; as long as it was covered in butter. &nbsp;So I chopped up some almonds (way too many) in my food processor, which didn&#8217;t really sliver them, I had varying sizes from dust to whole almonds, but it worked out ok.&nbsp;

  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After realizing I had to pick the ends off the green beans, I put the almonds aside and picked the green beans in front of the tv for what felt like forever. &nbsp;Also, I don&#8217;t think green beans are in season because these didn&#8217;t look too great. &nbsp;Anyway, boil those for about 2mins, maybe. &nbsp;I like them still crunchy, and not at all mushy.

  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After they&#8217;re done, mix butter, garlic, the almonds and the green beans together. &nbsp;First I tried this in a large mixing bowl, but that didn&#8217;t work at all. &nbsp;So into a tupperware they went and then they got all mixed up pretty well.

  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And just so you know, I didn&#8217;t only eat a pound of green beans for dinner (that might fly for pasta, but a vegetable? No way, not even one covered in butter). &nbsp;I also made some pork, which I will probably write up in just a couple minutes.
