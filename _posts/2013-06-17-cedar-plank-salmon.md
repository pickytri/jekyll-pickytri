So after making burgers on the grill almost every week for quite a while my roommate and I decided to try cedar plank salmon after I saw it while browsing some recipes online. &nbsp;The idea is the cedar will impart some smoky cedary flavor to the salmon while cooking. &nbsp;So I head out to Home Depot to pick up some cedar planks, originally searching the lumber section, and eyeing some power tools to cut up the wood. Realizing I could easily spend over $400 on wood and power tools I probably don&#8217;t need (but might someday), I sadly head over to the grilling section and find some pre-made cedar planks for grilling. &nbsp;At only $8 for 2 planks it was a close thing &#8211; had they been over $10 I might have opted for the 8ft planks of cedar and a sawzall. &nbsp;Anyway, after the trip to home depot I headed over to whole foods to get some salmon, where they were actually selling some on cedar planks. &nbsp;After picking up the salmon sans planks at whole foods, I soaked the home depot planks for a couple hours (along with some corn, which is beneath them)

  So to prepare the salmon, I just salted and peppered each side (maybe a bit too much salt, they tasted like they came right from the ocean).

  Up to the grill now. &nbsp;We had a bit of trouble at first with a grease fire (apparently no one really cleans community grills), but luckily there are 2 grills on my roof so we switched to the next one and after a thorough cleaning we got the salmon on the grill.

  I&#8217;m not sure what was with my camera that day, but most of the pictures are either really washed out because of flash, or blurry because of no flash and a longer exposure time. &nbsp;But the salmon cooked nicely for about 15 mins or so, and with 2 flips it came out looking mighty tasty

  Served with some rice and grilled corn on the cob

  The salmon was fantastic, as was the corn. &nbsp;I kind of ignored the rice and it was pretty bland. &nbsp;The only problem with the salmon was a bit too much salt. &nbsp;Some mouthfuls were like taking a drink of the ocean and getting some fish with it, others were pleasantly smokey and cedary. &nbsp;Overall a great meal I will repeat many times.



Recipe:

-about 6oz salmon per serving  
-salt and pepper to taste  
-cedar planks

Soak cedar planks for at least 1hr before grilling. &nbsp;Preheat grill to high, and when it gets hot enough put the planks on and turn heat down to medium. &nbsp;After 5mins flip planks and place salmon on them, skin side down. &nbsp;Grill for 10-15mins, until flaky and not translucent.
