12ish miles from where I started riding my bike, somewhere on the Platte River Trail or close to it (I dunno about 10 miles in the trail split like 4 ways and I just chose one randomly). There were so many people smoking pot next to the trail near downtown, also homeless people camps, which wasn&#8217;t so bad except they didn&#8217;t seem to realize people are biking down the path at almost 20mph. I don&#8217;t know which is worse, that or the industrial waste smells just north of downtown, I felt like I was choking on it. Probably the industrial waste smell, it was just so bad.
