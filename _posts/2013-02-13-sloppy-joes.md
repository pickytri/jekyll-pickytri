So this is the first post and for some info, I&#8217;m a triathlete and I train a bunch so I get to eat a bunch to make up for it. &nbsp;This is my blog for my own purposes to keep track of my what meals I&#8217;ve made and how they came out so I can help myself plan for future meals.

For the first meal on here, I made sloppy joes. &nbsp;Good for protein I suppose and a great reminder of summer and childhood, I&#8217;ve always liked sloppy joes even if they had onions &#8211; which I am slowly learning to like. &nbsp;I got the base recipe from [allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sloppy-joes-ii/)&nbsp;but changed it a little, substituting the 1/4 cup green pepper for more onions and leaving out the mustard because even smelling mustard is a challenge for me.

I toasted the buns and added some microwaved corn to make it &#8220;healthy.&#8221; &nbsp;I used about 1/4 of the meat for each roll. &nbsp;They came out great and I look forward to making them again. 

Recipe:

&#8211; 1ish lb ground beef  
&#8211; 1/2cup chopped onion  
&#8211; a bunch of minced garlic  
&#8211; 3/4cup ketchup  
&#8211; 3 teaspoons brown sugar  
&#8211; salt  
&#8211; pepper  
&#8211; red pepper flakes

In a skillet over medium heat brown the ground beef and onion. &nbsp;In a pot mix the garlic, ketchup, brown sugar and spices. &nbsp;Add the meat and onions when they are done, and simmer for 20-30mins. &nbsp;Toast buns and microwave corn. &nbsp;To serve, pour meat generously on each bun.
