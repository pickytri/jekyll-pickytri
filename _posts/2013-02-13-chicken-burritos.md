For the second meal (no I didn&#8217;t eat these both tonight, just been thinking about the blog for a while and have the pictures sitting around) I present chicken burritos. &nbsp;I made up this recipe based on the tacos we used to make as kids, basically my mom cooked up meat, had cheese, corn, sour cream and other stuff available and we made our own tacos. &nbsp;So.. I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m calling this a burrito if for all my childhood I called it a taco, I&#8217;m going to blame chipotle because that was the recent inspiration for the homemade version. 

Anyway I start with a flour tortilla (someday I&#8217;ll try to make my own)

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1GiZW2mEtRQ/URwpNCAWmII/AAAAAAAAAgU/C2AEJsiMgyQ/s1600/IMAG0076.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="382" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1GiZW2mEtRQ/URwpNCAWmII/AAAAAAAAAgU/C2AEJsiMgyQ/s640/IMAG0076.jpg" width="640" /></a>
</div>

Fry up some chicken breast (make sure to add plenty of salt and pepper) and chop up some onions.

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

Now brown the onions, while adding some&nbsp;tomato&nbsp;sauce to the tortilla (I know, I&#8217;m weird)

Ok, now add the chicken, onions and corn, and some more sauce because I don&#8217;t have/really like salsa&#8230;

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

Time for some cheese and that sour cream.. we are getting a bit crowded in this tortilla now&#8230; where does chipotle get those huge torillas??

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l1HG-tEXgRs/URwqnuHGPEI/AAAAAAAAAhE/YgN7zxAsuUU/s1600/IMAG0081.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="382" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l1HG-tEXgRs/URwqnuHGPEI/AAAAAAAAAhE/YgN7zxAsuUU/s640/IMAG0081.jpg" width="640" /></a>

Ok, this was the first of three that I ate that night. &nbsp;It was delicious if messy and not exactly a pretty rolled up burrito, which is why I am not showing you a final rolled up picture. &nbsp;It stayed together well enough for me to eat with only some messiness, which was also delicious to eat afterwards. &nbsp;Overall the 1ish lb of chicken, 1/2 onion and corn/cheese/sour cream made 3 burritos for dinner with another 2 easily for leftovers. &nbsp;This is certainly a meal for Saturdays after long bike rides.

Recipe:

&#8211; 1ish lb chicken breast chopped  
&#8211; A few tortillas  
&#8211; 8oz tomato sauce  
&#8211; sour cream  
&#8211; cheese  
&#8211; 1/2 onion, chopped  
&#8211; 1/2 lb corn  
&#8211; salt and pepper to taste

Brown chicken breast and chop, brown onions. &nbsp;Lay out tortilla and add sauce, chicken, corn, onions, cheese, sour cream and spices. &nbsp;Repeat. &nbsp;Repeat again. &nbsp;Enjoy.
