Pulled pork is great. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve wanted to make it for a while, but it is a little daunting when a recipe calls for over 8 hours of cooking, even using the slow cooker. &nbsp;But I planned ahead and started at 8am to let my 4lb pork shoulder cook until it was nice and tender, that was the plan at least. 
So here is the pork before:

The recipe I used called for 2 onions to be sliced and placed around the pork:

Then just cook it for 8hrs&#8230; and then start pulling the pork apart and put it back in:

I thought I could just pull the pork apart with 2 forks, but it turns out I needed to use my hands. &nbsp;It got messy. &nbsp;Anyway after that you add the BBQ sauce:

Another hour or so, and bam! pulled pork bbq:

Delicious, but something was missing. &nbsp;Not sure what else I wanted, but for some reason it wasn&#8217;t as tasty as I thought. &nbsp;Maybe I&#8217;ll try a different BBQ sauce next time.
