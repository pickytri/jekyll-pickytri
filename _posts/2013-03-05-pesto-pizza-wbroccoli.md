<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some new additions to my kitchen have been a pizza peel and a pizza stone, and I&#8217;ve used both to great results. &nbsp;Starting with some fresh dough I roll it out into a pizza like shape (my first few were irregular&nbsp;misshapen&nbsp;things, but I&#8217;ve since gotten somewhat better). &nbsp;Then you have to make the crust, just kind of roll up the edges.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Usually you would add the toppings now and put it in the oven, however if you are like me and your oven takes forever to heat up to what it says is 500F, but is really something more like 450F I would guess, then you would have to cook the dough first for 3-5 minutes. &nbsp;Then it&#8217;s out of the oven and time for some toppings:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is pesto that was made from fresh basil a while ago and frozen. &nbsp;I just used all of it up, so next time I need some pesto you can see how I make that. &nbsp;When using broccoli, I really&nbsp;under cook&nbsp;it beforehand in boiling water, maybe just a minute or two. &nbsp;Then add some cheese (I tried fresh&nbsp;mozzarella&nbsp;once and the pizza came out with water on it, so don&#8217;t opt for the fresh cheese).

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After about 10-15mins I guess, or the cheese is melted and the crust is starting to brown, take it out and let it sit for a minute or two before slicing and eating.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So far for the pizzas I&#8217;ve made this type of pesto one has come out better than the regular tomatto sauce and cheese variety.  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recipe:  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-11ish oz fresh pizza dough  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-3? tbs of pesto (enough to spread on dough)  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-1 head of broccoli  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-cheese to cover pizza  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-spices and such to taste (oregano, garlic, salt and pepper for me)  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Preheat oven to 500F with pizza stone inside, wait forever because oven is terrible. &nbsp;Roll out pizza dough and shape into circular disk with crust. &nbsp;Bake for 3-5mins because even though it took almost an hour to preheat, the oven is not really hot enough. &nbsp;Top the pizza with pesto, broccoli and cheese, bake for another 10mins, or until cheese is melted and crust is turning brown. &nbsp;Slice and enjoy.
