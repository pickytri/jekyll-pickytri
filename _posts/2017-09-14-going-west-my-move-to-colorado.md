So it&#8217;s been a while since a post, but I had a busy couple months with moving to Denver and then losing my wallet the second day I got there. Do you know how hard it is to pay for something with a check these days? Without an ID? Anyway, now that I&#8217;ve settled in a bit I thought I&#8217;d make a post about the move. <!--more-->

**Packing**

When planning my move I knew I wanted my car out west, and I also didn&#8217;t have too many large items that I wanted to bring so I figured I would just load the car with the essentials and go. It turns out &#8220;the essentials&#8221; is a whole lot of stuff. I was actually pretty surprised how much stuff I was able to fit in my car, and also how much stuff I had to leave behind. I didn&#8217;t bring a bed, but managed to pack in my bike, desk, computer, vacuum, 4 large plastic bins full of kitchen appliances, clothes, and random things. It was a tight fit.

Yeah I wasn&#8217;t able to see out of the rear view mirror.

It was pretty full. I&#8217;m really happy with my Honda Fit, it really is a great car for me. I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to fit as much in a regular 4 door.

**The Drive**

The drive out is a little over 1600miles, or about 25 hours according to google maps so I decided to split the drive into three days and aim for two 10-11hour days and then a 4ish hour day at the end since I still had to move my stuff in too. I was really dreading the legendary flatness of Kansas and the sheer mind numbing task of driving all day. It really wasn&#8217;t all that bad though, I listened to &#8216;A Game of Thrones&#8217; audio book and even though I&#8217;ve read it many times before, it was different hearing it, and it is something like 33hrs for the first book so I knew it would cover the trip.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-662" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/VAtoEarthCityzoomout.png" alt="" width="916" height="566" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/VAtoEarthCityzoomout.png 916w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/VAtoEarthCityzoomout-300x185.png 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/VAtoEarthCityzoomout-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/VAtoEarthCityzoomout.png)

The first day I was aiming for Effingham, IL but managed to make it to St. Louis. I left at 7am from VA and drove for 6hrs until a lunch stop in Deer Creek Township, Ohio. Then did another 4 hours until Effingham and still didn&#8217;t feel too tired or anything so I gassed up and went another 112 miles to St. Louis. For a total of 820 miles and about 11.5 hours of driving (I think, I crossed a timezone and just went by miles rather than time). Pretty good progress.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-660" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toCOzoomout.png" alt="" width="575" height="347" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toCOzoomout.png 575w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toCOzoomout-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toCOzoomout.png)

The second day was also good, Kansas was as big and flat as everyone said, but wasn&#8217;t any more or less boring to drive through than the rest of the states. It was strange to have exits so far apart and not all of them had gas stations. I was on about a 1/4 tank and got off at an exit to get gas, but there was nothing. No gas station, no town, no cell service, just fields. I got a little worried but got back on the highway and made it to the next exit with a gas station. I left at about 6am (local time) and drove for 5hrs before a lunch break. After lunch I drove another 5hrs and ended the day in Limon, CO. A total of about 750 miles and I could have made it to Denver. But then I&#8217;d have to pay more for a hotel since my lease didn&#8217;t start until the next day.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-661" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toDenver.png" alt="" width="1161" height="749" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toDenver.png 1161w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toDenver-300x194.png 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toDenver-768x495.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/toDenver.png)

The third day was a quick 1.5hr drive to Denver. That included Denver traffic and I arrived before my apartment leasing office opened.

Overall the drive went very well, much better than I expected. I think a combination of planning and the audio book really helped. And even though I could have made it in two days, if I did it again I&#8217;d probably still opt for three because having to move a car full of stuff into an apartment after 11-12hrs of driving doesn&#8217;t sound like a good time to me.

And for anyone wondering how I got the map images of where I was, it&#8217;s from google location history. If you turn it on you can see where you&#8217;ve been and when, or at least where your phone has been. It&#8217;s a little creepy and pretty invasive, but if you think about it, your phone is a GPS receiver and can also triangulate your position from cell towers, so google and your cell provider already know where you are all the time.

**The Apartment**

When I got to my apartment, a small studio, I was happy it wasn&#8217;t as small as I thought.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-648" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt1.jpg 2000w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt1-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt1.jpg)

That&#8217;s it. Bedroom, kitchen, dining room all in one. There&#8217;s also a bathroom but luckily that isn&#8217;t in the kitchen too. I&#8217;m also happy the kitchen island moves so I can slide it around if I need more room somewhere. The oven and dishwasher are both thin models, which I&#8217;m a little disappointed with, some of my pans don&#8217;t fit &#8211; I&#8217;d trade the thin dishwasher for a full size oven in an instant.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-663" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/view.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/view.jpg 2000w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/view-300x225.jpg 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/view-768x576.jpg 768w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/view-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/view.jpg)

The view isn&#8217;t bad, you can kinda see the mountains between the buildings, and there&#8217;s a view of the state capitol building (the gold dome on the right). The neighborhood is kinda in transition, there&#8217;s some abandoned plots, some upscale shopping, a fancy gym, a pawn shop, a hipster coffee place and an upscale grocery store all within two blocks. Oh and two pot dispensaries in that same two block radius, which is a little strange but you get used to it.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-649" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt2.jpg 2000w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt2-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apt2.jpg)

Here I am &#8220;moved&#8221; in. All my stuff is in the apartment, and I went shopping for the essentials but I haven&#8217;t really unpacked anything and still no bed. A sleeping bag on the hard floor here is not as comfortable as a carpet.

Now I&#8217;m more settled in, and it looks like this:<figure id="attachment_650" style="width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

I&#8217;m pretty happy with the kitchen setup. I also now have a pressure cooker so expect some new food related posts using that in the near future.
