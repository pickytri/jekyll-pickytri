<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Breakfast for dinner?&nbsp; It&#8217;s all possible when you are an &#8220;adult&#8221; !!&nbsp; To start preheat oven to 400F and get some baking trays ready for bacon.&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">That&#8217;s a pound and it&#8217;ll be ready in about 20mins, take a look at 15mins and finish to desired crispyness.&nbsp; Best part: no cleaning the pan, just toss the tinfoil, well that and the actual bacon&#8230;&nbsp; I just used some pancake mix, and pretty much follow the directions on the box.&nbsp; Flip when you see lots of bubbles forming:

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">That was the last one I made, which is always larger than the others.&nbsp; I top the pancakes with butter and maple syrup (which I&#8217;ve had for over 3 years now&#8230; the &#8216;best by&#8217; date is in 2010, but the jug also says it doesn&#8217;t go bad and it&#8217;s still tasty so fair game I say).&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Here&#8217;s how it looked before I ate it and was very satisfied.&nbsp; Maple flavored bacon and pancakes really work well together.&nbsp; This is really quick and easy because of the mix, one of these days I&#8217;ll actually make the pancakes from scratch and compare the taste.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Recipe:

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&#8211; 1.5cups dry pancake mix  
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&#8211; 1ish cup of water  
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&#8211; 1lb bacon  
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&#8211; maple syrup  
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&#8211; butter  
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Preheat oven to 400F, and put bacon in baking sheets lined with tinfoil.&nbsp; Cook for about 20mins.&nbsp; Mix pancake mix and water until lumpy.&nbsp; Pour a pancake sized portion of batter into skillet on medium heat, flip when bubbles are forming.&nbsp; <span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">T<span style="color: #333333;">his made 3<span style="color: #333333;"> 7ish inch <span style="color: #333333;">and 1 10ish inch pa<span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">ncakes.&nbsp; Top with butter and syrup.&nbsp; Enjoy.
