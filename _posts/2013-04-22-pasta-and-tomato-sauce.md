<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I eat so much pasta that my&nbsp;cupboard&nbsp;looks like I&#8217;m preparing for the apocalypse. &nbsp;But really I go through a pound or two a week so it only makes sense to keep 20-30lbs around. &nbsp;The most typical pasta meal is with tomato sauce, which I&#8217;ve recently upgraded from the straight up canned sauce thanks to my cooking class. &nbsp;Here are the ingredients:


{% responsive_image path: blogger/IMG_3965.jpg %}



  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Heat up the butter and olive oil in a sauce pan, adding the garlic and onions if you have them (and they didn&#8217;t go bad on you). &nbsp;



{% responsive_image path: blogger/IMG_3967.jpg %}



Yes, I used that much garlic.



{% responsive_image path: blogger/IMG_3971.jpg %}



  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Process that until smooth and then back into the sauce pan to simmer while you cook your pasta. &nbsp;I tried to get a good picture of the simmering, but it didn&#8217;t work out and it just looks like sauce in a pan. &nbsp;Also, I added some fresh basil leaves, salt and pepper to flavor it a bit.



{% responsive_image path: blogger/IMG_3976.jpg %}



  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finish the pasta up until al dente, and save some of the water it was cooked in to add to the sauce.



{% responsive_image path: blogger/IMG_3980.jpg %}



  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Add the water and pasta to the sauce, stir well.

  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And serve. &nbsp;I portion it by half pound, so a box of pasta will last two meals for me, unless its Saturday, then I have the whole pound.

  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Of course you can (and should) add cheese. &nbsp;Cheddar works great.
