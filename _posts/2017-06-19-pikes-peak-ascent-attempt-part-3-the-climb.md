I made it up! Running up Barr Trail was definitely an amazing experience, and something I want to do again, and wanted to repeat before I even finished it the first time. The quick stats:
  
Total time: 4:26:28
  
Distance: 11.32 miles (avg 23:31/mile)
  
Elevation gain: 7382ft
  
<!--more-->

Here are some pictures that I took on the way &#8211; note most are a little blurry/washed out because my phone was in a plastic bag the whole time to protect it from sweat.<figure id="attachment_572" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

At this point (about 6:30am) it was about 3/4 full. A quick picture and I was on my way. The weather was beautiful for running, clear and about 60-65F, with highs climbing into the mid 70s (but only at the base, further up in altitude it got colder and the summit was in the 40s with a windchill in the 20s).</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_573" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-large wp-image-573" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr01-1200x1014.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="444" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr01-1200x1014.jpg 1200w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr01-300x253.jpg 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr01-768x649.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr01.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Incline &#8211; a view of The Incline from Barr Trail, maybe 1.5 miles in. The Incline is a set of steep stairs about a mile in length with over 2000ft of climbing with connections to Barr Trail, it was pretty crowded even this early on a weekday &#8211; lots of people were running up the Incline and back down on Barr Trail. I&#8217;d like to try The Incline one day, but didn&#8217;t want to burn my legs out before climbing to the summit.</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_574" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="wp-image-574 size-large" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr02-1200x973.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="426" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr02-1200x973.jpg 1200w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr02-300x243.jpg 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr02-768x623.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr02.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The W&#8217;s &#8211; The first section of Barr Trail is a number of steep switchbacks known as the W&#8217;s affording the runner quick gains in elevation and beautiful views of nearby peaks. I wanted to stop every switchback to take a picture. There were quite a few hikers going up, and a couple runners from the incline coming down. I took this first part fairly easy because after all I still had a mountain to climb. This view is off to the left where you can see 2 or 3 other smaller peaks.</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_575" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-large wp-image-575" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr03-1200x1003.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="439" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr03-1200x1003.jpg 1200w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr03-300x251.jpg 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr03-768x642.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr03.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The W&#8217;s &#8211; another view from the W&#8217;s, this time back down the trail and towards the town of Manitou Springs.

I stopped inside and chatted about the summit (it&#8217;s snowy but melting) and they offered pancakes that were leftover from breakfast. It was about 1hr and 40mins into my run so I was way ahead of where I thought I&#8217;d be, and I was taking it pretty easy and keeping my HR way down. Up here the temperature was probably in the 50s but it felt good for running.</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_582" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-large wp-image-582" src="http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr10-1200x684.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="299" srcset="https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr10-1200x684.jpg 1200w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr10-300x171.jpg 300w, https://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr10-768x438.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" />](http://pickytri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barr10.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Stream Near Barr Camp &#8211; there is a stream to the left of the trail after Barr Camp where I filled my water filter bottle and walked for about 5-10 mins while I ate a cliff bar and finished off the water.

**The Data**

The following is more data oriented gathered from my watch on the way up.

Distance: 11.32 miles
  
Duration: 4:26:28 (or 3:29:07 moving time from Strava)
  
Elevation gain: 7382ft (1.39 miles)
  
HR avg: 147 bpm (on average easy runs I average about 160)
  
Calories burned: 3405
  
Daily Activity: 668% (my HR watch gives a daily activity goal of around an hour of activity, which it measures based on HR or something, usually an hour swim will put me about 150%, a long run will put me in the 200% range and a 4hr bike ride about 250%)

As you can see the first 3 miles are pretty steep and then it levels out in the middle a bit, then climbs again towards the end. The last .3 miles is when I pretty much eschewed the trail and went straight up.

Here&#8217;s a quick reminder of what my hill workouts were in preparation for the climb:<figure id="attachment_335" style="width: 857px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Here&#8217;s the elevation from the climb:<figure id="attachment_624" style="width: 875px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Each larger section on the vertical scale is 2000ft, over 10x more than I climbed in any hill repeat section in any of my training. Let that sink in again, the whole vertical scale of my hill repeats would fit between the bottom line and that small black line in the graph above. Surprisingly I didn&#8217;t have any problems climbing, my legs felt great and there was no burning quads or anything.</figcaption></figure>

**Notes for next time:**

My preparation was rather well I think, my legs didn&#8217;t hurt more than a typical long run. The elevation got to me towards the end, but there&#8217;s no real way to prepare for that other than elevation, and my options were limited. I had plenty of water, my nutrition was good, my HR stayed low. The only thing I&#8217;d change is to do it at a different time when there isn&#8217;t any snow up top. I think the snow makes for better pictures, but it was really a pain to climb through. Those last 2 miles took me about 1.5hrs when the 9 miles before that took about 3hrs. I&#8217;d like to do the race (they hold it in August when usually no snow is up there) but I&#8217;d also like to do it and bring my own water and everything again.
