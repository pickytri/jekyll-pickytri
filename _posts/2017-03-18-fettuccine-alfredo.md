I know, I know, another pasta dish, well get used to it, I like pasta. It&#8217;s quick (usually), it&#8217;s easy (most of the time), it&#8217;s delicious (almost always) and there are so many different dishes to choose from. Also note the &#8220;I&#8221; in the title, since there are about a million and a half recipes for fettuccine alfredo I am already planning ahead because I will make multiple versions.<!--more--> Anyway, this is a lighter fettuccine alfredo recipe (

#end)) that doesn&#8217;t have many ingredients, see:

{% responsive_image path: wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fet-alf00.jpg %}

just the pasta, cheese, butter, heavy cream and salt and pepper. First things first, put the water on to boil because while this takes maybe 10mins, when you want to eat it can seem like forever. Then grate the cheese into a smallish bowl:

ok so I forgot to put the corn starch in the ingredients picture. But still &#8211; this recipe doesn&#8217;t have many ingredients at all. Add the corn starch to the cheese and mix well. Meanwhile when the water starts to boil, add the pasta and cook until al dente:

then add the heavy cream, butter and salt/pepper to the cheese:

And reserve some of the pasta water for the sauce:

I actually remembered this time! Drain the pasta and return to the pot, adding the cheese mixture and mix well. Add pasta water to obtain desired consistency

and that&#8217;s it. Pretty easy. While very good it still felt like it was missing something. Maybe the seasoning, maybe something else, but expect another fettuccine alfredo recipe fairly soon. It might have to do with the cheese used &#8211; most recipes call for parmigiano reggiano and I used pecorino romano.
