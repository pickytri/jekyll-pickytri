<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Compared to scalloped potatoes, baked potatoes are sooo easy. &nbsp;Preheat oven to 400, wash potatoes (and cut out black parts if they have them, like mine did this time). &nbsp;Some olive oil and salt, then they are ready for the oven:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So some of these pictures are blurry, I suppose I&#8217;ll stop using my cell phone for pictures and switch to my nice camera for future pics. &nbsp;Cooking takes at least an hour, so don&#8217;t start them at 8pm after riding your bike, like I did. &nbsp;I was sooo hungry and very tempted to eat them before they finished cooking, but having done that in the past I knew I should wait because raw potatoes are not the most tasty thing I&#8217;ve ever eaten. &nbsp;  
{% responsive_image path: blogger/><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Anyway, the interesting part of baked potatoes are the toppings, the standard butter works well, but that can get boring. &nbsp;Sour cream, cheese and bacon work really well if you have them, but probably aren&#8217;t the most healthy options. &nbsp;My favorite topping is probably just cottage cheese, they go really well together. &nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As I said, baked potatoes are real easy. &nbsp;This was great a great meal, but looking at this picture tells me I probably could have had some kind of vegetable along with these potatoes. &nbsp;Broccoli is my goto for baked potatoes, and as an added bonus it also works well with cottage cheese.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-Enough potatoes to satisfy your appetite</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-Olive oil</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-Salt/pepper</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-toppings (butter / sour cream / cheese / bacon / cottage cheese)</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Preheat oven to 400F. &nbsp;Wash potatoes and lightly coat with olive oil, salt and pepper. &nbsp;Poke some holes in the potatoes with a fork, cook on tinfoil for around an hour. &nbsp;Potatoes are done when easily squeezed in the middle (use pot holder). &nbsp;Split with a fork down the middle and top with whatever you like. &nbsp;</span>
