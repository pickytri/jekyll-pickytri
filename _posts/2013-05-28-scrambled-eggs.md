I recently came across Gordon Ramsey video of scarmbled eggs so I thought I would try them out his way. &nbsp;Start off with your eggs, and a tablespoon or 2 of butter in a pot:

Don&#8217;t season it until the end. &nbsp;And now start mixing with a spatula (your arm will probably get tired by the end of this process &#8211; mine did). &nbsp;When it starts to thicken up, take it off the heat and keep mixing.

In the video Gordon says to take it off and put it on the heat 3-4 times, I usually end up doing it about twice that amount because I probably don&#8217;t wait long enough when it is on the heat. &nbsp;Anyway, when they are looking about done, take it off the heat for the final time and add creme fraiche (or sour cream because you don&#8217;t have any creme fraiche).

This will cool off the eggs and stop them from continuing to cook, and as with my mashed potatoes a couple weeks ago I added a bit too much and my eggs came out a bit runnier than I was aiming for. &nbsp;They still tasted great so no worries. &nbsp;Instead of serving with mushrooms and tomato like Gordon, I used a leftover burger topped with cheddar.

One of these days I&#8217;ll be able to use the correct amount of sour cream&#8230; &nbsp;Anyway, for anyone wondering if leftover burgers go with eggs the answer is yes. &nbsp;Before Gordons youtube video, this meal would have ended up being more a fried hash of burger, egg and cheese &#8211; which is also good, but these eggs come out like they are soaked in butter (even the first time I made them and forgot to add any butter). &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been making these once a week for a while now, which is worrisome because I have also added many other things to my weekly schedule, like burgers. &nbsp;I&#8217;m slightly concerned that I&#8217;m going to run out of days to try new meals on because I like the ones I cook too much to skip them. &nbsp;Admittedly,&nbsp;this is a good problem to have and half the reason I started this blog &#8211; to force myself to keep making new things so I have something to post.

Recipe:

-4 eggs  
-2 tablespoons butter  
-a bit of creme fraiche  
-salt and pepper to taste
