<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So I have made pesto pizza but haven&#8217;t shown you how to make Pesto yet, well here&#8217;s my recipe. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve got a basil plant growing in my apartment that I haven&#8217;t managed to kill yet, even after my first harvest of the leaves (which were used for this pesto). &nbsp;This is my plant after harvesting, I got about 1.5-2cups of packed leaves depending on how tightly you packed them.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you can&#8217;t tell from the picture, its snowing outside. &nbsp;In March. &nbsp;In Virginia. &nbsp;The one time of the year it actually sticks to the ground here and they didn&#8217;t even cancel work. &nbsp;Oh well.  
{% responsive_image path: blogger/><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Anyway, this works best with a food processor, I can&#8217;t imagine having to make pesto with a mortar and pestle. &nbsp;It would probably take weeks. &nbsp;With the food processor just toss in all the ingredients:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And then process until it looks like pesto. &nbsp;And presto, you have pesto!
