I just imported my old posts from when I first started blogging about food. These were from [my old blogspot](http://pickytri.blogspot.com) and the format is a little different so there are some quirks.

As another site update, I&#8217;m currently hosting this site on my raspberry pi that I talked about in earlier posts [here](http://pickytri.com/index.php/2017/03/07/raspberry-pi-home-server-part-1-what-is-it-and-what-can-it-do/) and [here](http://pickytri.com/index.php/2017/03/07/raspberry-pi-home-server-part-1-what-is-it-and-what-can-it-do/). I&#8217;m still sorting through the migration so some links might be broken for now, but most should be working.
