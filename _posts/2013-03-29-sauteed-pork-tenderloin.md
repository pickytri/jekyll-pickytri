After seeing a commercial on the food network for pre made and frozen green beans and almond slivers, I decided I could probably make it and eat it&#8230; as long as it was covered in butter. &nbsp;So I chopped up some almonds (way too many) in my food processor, which didn&#8217;t really sliver them, I had varying sizes from dust to whole almonds, but it worked out ok.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Don&#8217;t forget to salt and pepper both sides of the pork. &nbsp;You also want to cut off any excess fat if you don&#8217;t care for it so much.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sautéing is a pretty general term for using some kind of fat (oil, butter, etc) to cook something, in most cases some kind of protein (pork, chicken, etc). &nbsp;So you want to get your pan heated up, and then add your fats, I used both olive oil and butter.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Next you lightly coat both sides of each pork medallion in the flour and place it in the pan. &nbsp;Let it get nice and brown before moving them around so much. &nbsp;I had no problems with anything sticking, and this is apparently because you let each side brown before moving them around.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Let them cook pretty much undisturbed except for flipping them, and maybe rearranging them if your stove doesn&#8217;t distribute heat very evenly (like mine). &nbsp;After a couple minutes they should be good to go.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And yes, I ate my veggies that night along with the delicious pork tenderloin:

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The pork was delicious. &nbsp;So much better than just pan frying with some PAM sprayed in there, and not even that much harder. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t wait for my new sauté pan to arrive so I can make the pan sauce as well. &nbsp;Apparently that is what makes restaurant food taste really good, and from what we had in class it works.</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recipe:</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-about 1lb of pork tenderloin</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-about 1cup flour</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-1 or 2 tbsp olive oil</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-1tbsp butter</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-salt/pepper</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat until warm. &nbsp;Meanwhile slice pork and blot dry with paper towels. &nbsp;Spread out flour on a large plate and coat each pork side with salt and pepper (no flour yet!). &nbsp;</span>  
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When the skillet is hot enough, add olive oil and butter and coat the pan. &nbsp;Now lightly coat pork on both sides and place in pan. &nbsp;Cook until browned on the bottom and then flip the pieces over and repeat. &nbsp;Pork is done when firm to touch, total cooking time should be around 4-5mins.</span>
