<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While my stand mixer gets regular use with other things, I think I&#8217;ve used it the most to make mashed potatoes. &nbsp;Mashed potatoes are a great side dish for many people, but I make a meal around or out of just the potatoes. &nbsp;For this dinner I had just a large bowl of them, and it was delicious. &nbsp;Anyway, start with potatoes, wash them, and slice them into about 1.5 inch cubes.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then you boil these for around 10-15mins, until you can easily stab through them with a fork. &nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I&#8217;ve heard potato ricers work well for mashing, but I&#8217;m kind of lazy so I just toss them in the mixer with some milk, garlic, salt, pepper and butter. &nbsp;This time I had cheese and sour cream on hand as well, so I tossed those in as well. &nbsp;Note &#8211; this was about 1.5lb of potatoes and that was too much sour cream, they came out a bit more soupy than I would have liked.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Just process on a low speed until desired consistency. &nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As I said before, these came out kind of soupy, but still delicious. &nbsp;Less milk/sour cream would have helped the consistency. &nbsp;</span>
